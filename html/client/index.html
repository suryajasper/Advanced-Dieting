      <h3>Ever been on a diet but it didn't work?</h3>
      <p>Well, you're in the right place. Advanced dieting is a great solution that will meet all of your dietary needs by finding you the healthiest food possible depending on your specific needs.
      </p>
      <h3>What do I need to do?</h3>
      <p>
        All you have to do is <a style = "color: blue" href = "/signup.html">create an account</a> to get started and answer some simple questions about any conditions you might have or, more specifically, anything you want to reduce or anything you hope to gain. Just take a minute of your time to give us that information and let us do the rest. Our website will scour the internet and give you recommendations that best fit your needs! You can also filter based on meal type, preset diets, allergies, and cuisines.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I track my progress?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely! Whenever you eat something, you can just enter it into our website, and we'll add it to your history. But sometimes, you might forget to enter something, so we allow you to add things you ate before into your history. In fact, we have a variety of charts to show you how your health is doing over time. We can show you how much food you're getting per food group, your daily, weekly, or even monthly trends, and how well the diet is working for you based on your weight over time. We understand that you might not have the ingredients at home to make the healthiest options, and there's absolutely no need to rush to the store for a single meal. Just enter the ingredients you currently have in your kitchen into the website, and we'll only recommend you foods that can be made with those ingredients and fit your dietary needs.
      </p>
      <h3>So, what's the catch?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely nothing! Our website is completely free to use! No ads! No annoying subscription popups! You'll have access to almost all our features including customized, algorithmic recommendations and progress tracking. However, with a premium subscription, you will have access to ingredient-based recommendations. With just a few dollars per month, you will receive recommendations that fit your dietary needs and can be made with the food you have at home.
